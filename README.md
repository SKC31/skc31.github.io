# Zambia Kitchen — Zambian Recipes Website

This is a small static starter site showcasing Zambian recipes. It's built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and stores user-submitted recipes and favorites in localStorage.

How to run
1. Clone or download the files into a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser OR start a simple static server:
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8080`
   - Node (serve): `npx serve .`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or open the file).

Next steps / ideas
- Add a backend API (Node/Express + MongoDB or SQLite) to persist submissions.
- Add images and better metadata (prep/cook times, servings, allergens).
- Allow users to upload recipes via auth (GitHub/Email) and moderate submissions.
- Add tagging, regional filters (Copperbelt, Lusaka, Northern), and printable recipe cards.
- Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
